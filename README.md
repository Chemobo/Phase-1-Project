## SetUp Instruction
### Requirements
* Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.
* Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc). Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.
* Text editor eg [Visual Studio Code]
* [Testing Platform](Platform URL) Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.
